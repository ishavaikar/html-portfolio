<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Isha Vaikar, an engineering student at PES Modern College of Engineering. I have a strong interest in both coding and designing, 
  and I am currently immersed in learning full stack development. This project represents my first significant step toward completing the entire
   full stack course.</p>

<p>I am fortunate to be learning this course under the guidance of Dr. Angela Yu, an exceptional teacher whose expertise and teaching style 
  have greatly enriched my learning experience. This project is particularly meaningful to me as it integrates many of the concepts and skills 
  I have acquired during the HTML class. Through this project, I am not only applying what I have learned but also pushing the boundaries of my 
  understanding and capabilities in web development.</p>

<p>I am excited to see how this project unfolds and how it will contribute to my growth as a full stack developer. Thank you for taking the 
  time to read about my journey.</p>
